This project is part of my learning journey through The Odin Project, and it has been an amazing hands-on experience. Building this webpage helped me deeply understand how HTML and CSS work together to create structured and visually appealing layouts.

Through this project, I was able to:

Strengthen my HTML fundamentals

Improve my CSS styling skills

Gain solid confidence in using Flexbox to position and align elements

Learn how to build clean, responsive webpage layouts

I can now confidently design and structure a webpage using modern, professional layout techniques.

A big thank you to The Odin Project, the lessons and exercises are well-structured, practical, and incredibly effective for mastering web development basics.
